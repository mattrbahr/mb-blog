My main gig is as the founder & CEO ofÂ [Fairing](https://fairing.co), we're a Shopify app that enables merchants to collect qualitative data from their customers post-purchase. My career in ecommerce started a decade ago. Up until Fairing, I was on the merchant (brand) side, leading all things digital and growth.

Along with running Fairing, I currently advise and consult for wide range of companies, from direct-to-consumer brands to public companies.

I currently reside in New York, NY.
